# Wiz of Data Vis
### Stream 2 <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course/wiz-viz/index.html" target="_blank">Wiz of Data Viz</a> of Coding Club's <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course/" target="_blank"> *Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists* </a> course

Here you will find all the course materials for the "Wiz of Data Vis" stream of our Data Science course, e.g. the datasets used in the tutorials, and occasionally some starter scripts. 

### How to use this repository

Each tutorial has a link to a GitHub repository that contains the data needed to work through the code examples. If you are only planning on doing a few tutorials from this stream, you may choose to download only specific materials, but otherwise, __we suggest you download this whole repository in one go__, and therefore you will not have to download data folders separately each time. 

+ Click on the green button *"Clone or Download"* in the top right corner of the screen.
+ Download the repository as a ZIP file, and save it preferably somewhere close to the root of your computer (e.g. *C:/CC_course_stream2*). __Avoid saving it in a folder that has spaces of special characters in its name.__
+ All the data is now on your computer!

__For even better ease of working, you can create a Project in RStudio that will be associated with the Stream folder.__
+ In RStudio, go to *File / New Project / Create from existing directory* and navigate to your folder.
+ Create the project. You should see the name of your project appear in the top right corner. 
+ Now, instead of setting a _working directory_ in each script, you can use _relative paths_ to load your data. This is good practice because you could share the whole folder with someone else, and as long as they create a project in the main Stream folder too, they will be able to run your code without changing anything. 


### Working through the tutorials

You will notice that the tutorial folders have been numbered; this is only a suggestion of a logical, progressive order for this stream, but you don't have to follow it!
