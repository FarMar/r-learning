# CC-2-RMarkdown
Using R Markdown to construct reproducible code

This repository contains the files necessary to complete the Coding Club R Markdown tutorial - you can check it out at 
https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/24/rmarkdown-1.html

`RMarkdown_Tutorial.R` provides a basic R script to work with using the online tutorial material, to turn into an R Markdown document.

The data (`edidiv.csv`) were downloaded from the NBN Gateway https://data.nbn.org.uk/ for educational purposes.

`rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf` was downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf 

The 3 demo R scripts (`RMarkdown_Demo_1.R`, `RMarkdown_Demo_2.R`, `Rmarkdown_Demo_3.R`) are provided as examples which can be easily turned into R Markdown files.
