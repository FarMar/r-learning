### Set working directory



### Install packages as needed



### Load packages

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


## Import data
trees_bicuar <- read.csv("trees_bicuar.csv")
trees_mlunguya <- read.csv("trees_mlunguya.csv")

# The data contains information on tree stems surveyed in four 1 Ha plots at fieldsites around southern Africa. 
# trees_bicuar contains data for trees in Bicuar National Park in southwest Angola, and trees_mlunguya contains 
# data for trees in southern Mozambique. Each tree stem >5 cm trunk diameter was measured for tree height and 
# trunk diameter, and identified to species.

#### FUNCTIONS

# The basic syntax for creating a function looks like this:
example.fn <- function(x, y) {
  # perform an action using x and y
  x + y
}

# The function() command is used to tell R that we are creating a function, and we are assigning the function 
# to an object called example.fn. x and y are “arguments” for the function, i.e. things that the user provides 
# when running the function, then in the curly brackets are the actions performed by the function, using the 
# parameters defined by the user earlier in the function call, and any other objects in the working environment 
# in this case adding x and y together.

example.fn(x = 1, y = 2)

# You should get an output of 3, because the function example.fn() was provided with the values of x = 1 and 
# y = 2, which were then passed to the function, which performed the operation x + y. Note that the convention 
# is to name a function using . rather than _ which is normally used to define data objects. This isn’t a rule, 
# but it’s best to stick to the conventions used by other programmers to keep things consistent.

# we can also define a function that calculates the basal area of each stem in m^2 from the diameter, which is in 
# cm. The basal area is the cross-sectional area of the tree trunk if it was cut parallel to the ground.

basal.area <- function(x) {
  (pi*(x)^2)/40000
}

basal.area(x = trees_bicuar$diam)

# Function arguments don’t need to be called x and y, they can be any character string, for example, the function 
# below works identically to the one above, only x is now referred to as dbh:

basal.area <- function(dbh) {
  (pi*(dbh)^2)/40000
}

basal.area(dbh = trees_bicuar$diam)

# Additionally, you can add a indeterminate number of extra arguments using the `...` operator. Imagine that we 
# want to extend our `basal.area()` function so that it can compute the combined basal area of multiple vectors 
# of diameter measurements, e.g. from multiple sites:

basal.area <- function(...) {
  (pi*c(...)^2)/40000
}

basal.area(trees_bicuar$diam, trees_mlunguya$diam)

# Just like a normal function, the output of basal.area() can be assigned to a new object, for example, as a new 
# column in trees_bicuar:

trees_bicuar$ba <- basal.area(trees_bicuar$diam)

# Functions are essentially small programs. There's nothing different here between writing out the formula numerous
# times for each dataset. In my soils world this might be quite useful e.g. for calculating bulk density, applying
# moisture correction, turning concentractions into stocks. It could also be useful in isotope land for bulk-processing
# data, be it raw (LIMS replacement) or for uptake calculations. Not really any different to dragging a formula
# row around in Excel at this basic level, but good to build on.
