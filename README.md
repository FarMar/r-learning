# r-learning
Multiple folders of random R code, exercises, and learnings. This repository is the product of my R learnings whilst attending AFDS, particularly stats tuition by [Dr Terry Neeman (ANU)](https://services.anu.edu.au/business-units/statistical-consulting-unit/dr-terry-neeman), and also collates previous knowledge gained from Dr Alain Zuur and associates at [Highland Statistics](http://www.highstat.com/)*


*Note, code and tutorials from the HighStat course are protected by copyright and cannot be shared. The only shared content here is code for my own data following the principles learned in the HighStat course.
