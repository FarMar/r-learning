# r-learning
Multiple folders of random R code, exercises, and learnings. This repository is the product of my R learnings whilst attending AFDS, particularly stats tuition by [Dr Terry Neeman (ANU)](https://services.anu.edu.au/business-units/statistical-consulting-unit/dr-terry-neeman), and also collates previous knowledge gained from Dr Alain Zuur and associates at [Highland Statistics](http://www.highstat.com/)*. I have also taken a look at the [WSU R course notes](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie/events/data_analysis_r) provided by Remko Duursma & Jeff Powell.

It will hopefully grow over time, and I'll add a summary up here and more in-depth text under headings for each new concept below. Given that we're using R here, most of the analysis etc will be reported using RMarkdown outputs from knitR.


*Note, code and tutorials from the HighStat course are protected by copyright and cannot be shared. The only shared content here is code for my own data following the principles learned in the HighStat course.
